# Tap-Tap-Buuf-
A BUUF version of the well known game, Flappy Bird. This was written for iPhone in Swift 2. You can change the assets and font to make it your own. 

# How to Compile?
Use Xcode

# License?
Not really sure which one to use...maybe BSD? Just don't repackage and call it your own :)
If you make something cool out of this, be sure to make a pull request so others can see how easily you can make themed just for you!
